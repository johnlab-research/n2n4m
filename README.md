# Noise 2 Noise For Mars (N2N4M)
## Official repository for the ICLR ML4RS 2024 paper "Noise2Noise Denoising of CRISM Hyperspectral Data".

#### Abstract
Hyperspectral data acquired by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) have allowed for unparalleled mapping of the surface
mineralogy of Mars. Due to sensor degradation over time, a significant portion of the recently acquired data is considered unusable. Here a data-driven model,
Noise2Noise4Mars (N2N4M), is introduced to remove noise from CRISM images. We demonstrate its strong performance on synthetic noise data and CRISM
images, and its impact on downstream classification performance, outperforming the benchmark method on most metrics. This should allow for detailed analysis
for critical sites of interest on the Martian surface, including proposed lander sites.
